Learning the basics is key to building a strong foundation.

Little bit about me:
I started coding mid way through high school. Learned very basic concepts that sparked an interest in computers and computer languages. Did not start taking classes for coding till freshman year of college. First langauge I learned was Java. Have started to learn more langauges now. Have programed in Python, C, C++, C#, JavPHP and SQL. I am still learning all the langauges but believe the more exposure to the langauges strengthens the core concepts of the langauges. 

In my spare time from school work, I practice my coding skills by making simple projects. When not coding I am usually playing sports or hanging out with friends.
